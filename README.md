# Point Of Sale System Project in CodeIgniter with Source Code

The **Point Of Sale System Project in CodeIgniter** focuses on managing stock goods, including total incoming and outgoing items, among other things.

The system also displays all accessible information on suppliers, items, and their units, types, and other characteristics.

In addition, the system allows you to manage product types by simply typing their names into the system.

The **POS System Project in CodeIgniter** comprises two sections: the Admin Panel and the Employee Panel.

In this web application overview, the administrator has access to everything and can manage it quickly.

The supplier records can be managed by the admin.

When it comes to keeping track of inbound goods transactions, supplier records are crucial.

Furthermore, the administrator must keep track of items related to goods, such as their units and categories.

To manage items, the user must input a name, select a unit, and set a price. By default, the quantity value of goods remains 0 after entering goods data, which the admin should later update based on arriving products.
